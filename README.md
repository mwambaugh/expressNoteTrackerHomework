## User Story 
* AS A small business owner
* I WANT to be able to write and save notes
* SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Usage 
I have created an application called Note 'tracker' Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
